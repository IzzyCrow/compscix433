Instructions: Have all the code for all the questions in one Jupyter notebook and upload
the file at the time of submission. I will only consider these this file format for grading.
So, after you uploaded the file, check the file extension and if it is not an ipynb,
then upload the right file.


Way to present:
# Solution 1 to indicate solution to question 1. Please submit original work.

 

Go to
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality

and download the Excel file.

Use Pandas to perform the following:

1) read the Excel file and create a dataframe

2) Find the number of columns and rows

3) Print the first 5 rows of the dataframe

4) Find the data type of the columns

5) Find the missing values in the column and replace them with the mean of the column

6) Find the correlation between features.

Pick features that are least correlated and perform linear regression
Find the mean squared and r-squared errors for the training and test.
